My code is capable of doing most of the system commands using system function
But some of function on some extent are made by my own
Those functions are:
cp
mv 
ls
ps
grep
with some of there options
To call them add "my" prefix to all example mycp, myls
My code contains a Makefile so to create an execuatable file, give command make
To execute it give command ./myshell
Here you are in the terminal made by me
To know what it do ,give it a command help (Case-insensitive)
